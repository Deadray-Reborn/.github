# Project: "Deadray Reborn"
Long story short... This project is a Revive of the holy grail, Original Deadray, that used PocketMine-MP as the Original Server Program and is now updated to the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (formerly known as Minecraft: Pocket Edition when Deadray was first created)

### + The History from 2014-2016
The server was orginally called "JoshCraft", named after the original server Owner/CEO, Josh Escobar, Until it got re-branded into the name "Deadray" in 2016

The server we have today is nothing compared to the Deadray we used to have... This is where it starts to go into a downfall state from 2016 to present time...

### + Year 2016 to Present Time (2024)
The server's history was almost completely lost... some others say it has been deleted off of the face of the Earth... Some others say it was archived and never to be seen again... Any piece of history we have has been Archived... and closed source and floatng down the river as we speak...

Except this one piece of history we will never forget... The transfer from PocketMine-MP, The best server software that was iconic to Deadray... to CloudburstMC's Nukkit, That was based on JavaVM and was very sluggish and slow...

Ever since the transfer, we have lost every element of the world that was BUILT on PocketMine-MP, Then we had to go through the steps to convert it into a Nukkit-Formatted world

After the format to fit in with Nukkit... You could say everything was lost... Faction bases; Builds that didn't render correctly were glitched, bugged and deleted... There again... Deleted from the face of the earth that we live on...

The only builds that were left were places that were spawn protected... and never should get destroyed... Cloudtopia and the Iconic Server Spawnpoint was Two (2) important places at that time, but it is a long story on how it was created... But almost wiped...

### + The "Actual Part" of the PMMP to Nukkit Transfer...
When the transfer happened, Plugins... were no more... they weren't compatible with Nukkit... This was because PocketMine-MP was based on PHP Programming Language an dused the ".phar" file extension for main server file and MOST of the plugins...

At the time we only had a "Nick" plugin and some Building Utilities like FAWE... Not to mention it was no longer a Factions server anymore, which that plugin was alos removed and set to never return...

Nukkit was a lot more slower than PocketMine-MP, it felt... Not very good... World Load Time and Generation was terrible, Server starting was a hassle, and no one liked the fact that they removed Factions because it was an important element of the server...

At that time the Real server owners mentioned they had no more control... And they were only recognized as members by "The Founders" because they call themselves "OG Owners"... which they arn't really OG Owners to begin with...

The Founders whom what they call themselves "OG Owners" is JavaJar "The Founder" and SonicFireball4 who is a Developer working with Java to "Bring a better experience" to the OG Deadray we have now... Along with a lot of other "Admins" that were on their side...

The OG Deadray was never to be seen again as "OG (Original)" only because the transfer of Nukkit killed everything and hasn't added a single plugin that we liked, or ever since the transfer for that matter...

Old players didn't seem to want to join anymore because they "Grew Up" and "Moved On" or they didn't want to join anymore because of the server's state...

Until November 20th of year 2024. There would be a new Organization called "Deadray Reborn"... And it was gonna change EVERYTHING from here on out...

### + The Rise of Deadray Reborn
Until then... on November 22nd, it was a very peaceful friday afternoon when all of the sudden a unique player wanted to so something about it...

On that day, an all new Organization has appeared that is Unofficially, but, proudly founded by Michael R. Alexander AKA "Sandman" has came back too get a "revenge" type thing for this issue, and also talked and kept in touch with Josh Escobar "Mainly" for promoting this new Organization, and also to keep it secret at all costs...

On Saturday, November 23rd, At 12:00 in the morning, Sandman has began collaborating along with Josh Escobar, the Official Owner/CEO of Original Deadray, to bring back the REAL Original Deadray known as "Deadray Reborn" and is set to be announced on Monday December 9th, 2024 and is set to fully release on Monday, January 6th, 2025, Or it maybe delayed... No news on it has been released ever 

Sandman's mission as a Real Founder who takes Reicito and Josh's ADVICE seriously as the Server Moderator/Maintainer, will run it like a "golden dream" while as taking down "The Founders" JavaJar and SonicFireball4 who call themselves as the "OG Server Owner" of Deadray Original...

This is when Sandman sparked a new Idea to create "Deadray Reborn", to have the OG Server Software, Factions to be re-added and more and more features to come...
