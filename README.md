# Project: "Deadray Reborn"
Long story short... This project is a Revive of the holy grail, Original Deadray, that used PocketMine-MP as the Original Server Program and is now updated to the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (formerly known as Minecraft: Pocket Edition when Deadray was first created)

### + The History from 2014-2016
The server was orginally called "JoshCraft", named after the original server Owner/CEO, Josh Escobar, Until it got re-branded into the name "Deadray" in 2016

The server we have today is nothing compared to the Deadray we used to have... This is where it starts to go into a downfall state from 2016 to present time...

### + Year 2016 to Present Time (2024)
The server's history was almost completely lost... some others say it has been deleted off of the face of the Earth... Some others say it was archived and never to be seen again... Any piece of history we have has been Archived... and closed source and floating down the river as we speak...

Except this one piece of history we will never forget... The transfer from PocketMine-MP, The best server software that was iconic to Deadray... to CloudburstMC's Nukkit, That was based on JavaVM and was very sluggish and slow...

Ever since the transfer, we have lost every element of the world that was BUILT on PocketMine-MP, Then we had to go through the steps to convert it into a Nukkit-Formatted world

After the format to fit in with Nukkit... You could say everything was lost... Faction bases; Builds that didn't render correctly were glitched, bugged and deleted... There again... Deleted from the face of the earth...

The only builds that were left were places that were spawn protected... and never should get or got destroyed... Cloudtopia, The Server's Main Spawnpoint, and the Iconic JoshCraft Server Spawnpoint were the three (3) important places at that time, but it is a long story on how it was created... But almost wiped...

### + The "Actual Part" of the PMMP to Nukkit Transfer...
When the transfer happened, Plugins... were no more... they weren't compatible with Nukkit... This was because PocketMine-MP was based on PHP Programming Language and used the ".phar" file extension for main server file, the server plugins used ".phar" aswell, If it attempted to load a ".jar" plugin, it would load and mosty likely corrupt anything in the server's directory...

At the time we only had a "Nick" plugin and some Building Utilities like FAWE... Not to mention there was no longer a factions plugin either, or atleast nothing compared to Pocketmine's factions plugin, which was a very good plugin at its time...

Nukkit was a lot more slower than PocketMine-MP, it felt... Not very good... World Load Time and Generation was terrible and Server starting was a hassle...

At that time the REAL server owners mentioned they had no more control, meaning the whole server was OUT OF CONTROL... And they were only recognized as "Just regular server owners" by "The Founders" because they call themselves the "OG Owners"... which they arn't really OG Owners to begin with...

The Founders' names are JavaJar who was originally a founder since Deadray was "given to" him and SonicFireball4 who is a Developer working with JavaJar to "Bring a better experience" to the OG Deadray we have now... Along with a lot of other "Admins" that were on their side...

Deadray was never to be seen again as the "OG (Original)" only because the transfer of Nukkit killed everything and hasn't added a single plugin that we liked, or ever since the transfer for that matter...

Old players didn't seem to want to join anymore either because they "Grew Up" and "Moved On", or they just didn't want to join anymore because of the server's state...

Until November 20th of year 2024, right before Thanksgiving, there's a new Organization called "Deadray Reborn" that appeared secretly... No one knows about it until the specified date, as of which it would be announced on that date... Wednesday December 18th, 2024... And it was gonna change EVERYTHING from here on out... Only the creator of Deadray Reborn and the collaborators of it knew what was coming and will be a "Permanent Change" to Deadray's "aspect"...

### + The Rise of Deadray Reborn
On Saturday November 30th, at 12:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, Sandman has began collaborating along with Josh Escobar, the Official Owner/CEO of Original Deadray, to grab the server files and to bring back the REAL Original Deadray known as "Deadray Reborn" and its Organization is set to be announced on Wednesday December 18th, 2024 and is planned to fully release on Monday January 6th, 2025... But there may be potential delays due to a much slower development and may have a full fledged release on a later date... 

This organization is official to Original Deadray and proudly founded AND owned by Michael R. Alexander, also holds the nickname "Sandman", has came back to get a "revenge" type thing for all the issues occured, and has also talked to and kept in touch with Josh Escobar, The Original Owner/CEO of Deadray, mainly for promoting and advertising this new Organization...

Sandman's mission as a Founder who takes Reicito and Josh's ADVICE seriously as the Server Moderator/Maintainer, will run it like a "golden dream" while as taking down the Founders, JavaJar and SonicFireball4, and to retake rights and ownership of Deadray's Original Server and give them to Josh and Reicito...
